# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on predicting Brain Tumor using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Algorithm. 
The code uses Early Stopping and Model Checkpoint in order to avoid unnecessary run of epochs if encounters, same validation accuracy for more than two times, hence making the code more efficient.
The attained validation accuracy is 90%.

Dataset Description:-
-> The dataset contains 2 folders - Training and Testing
-> Each folder consists, MRI images of brain Tumor and Normal Human Brain.
